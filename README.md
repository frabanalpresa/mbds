Natural Language Processing fundamentals
========================================

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a very active topic in both academical and commercial worlds. Humans aim to teach machines how to read and interpret full texts, being able to extract abstract knowledge from them the same way humans teach other humans for years. Current applications of natural language processing tasks include automatic Web searchers, text summarization and classification... On the other hand, potential applications are only limited to the creativity of the human being.

Along these notes, the reader will be introduced to one of the basic subtasks of Natural Language Processing, and walked through some algorithms to solve them. Also, some references are included for the curious reader to widen the understanding of the matter.

### It is part of MBDS program

[MBDS](https://www.tel.uva.es/docencia/planes/masterbds.htm) program is a MSc degree from University of Valladolid (UVa, Spain), aimed to provide postgraduate education in Big Data and Data Science fields as an introductory point in a business-oriented approach.

## What to expect from these slides

This is an introduction to NLP problems and algorithms from an informative perspective, not a technical one. The student is expected to learn the basics of NLP, recognize an NLP problem and propose a classic solution towards its solution. Cutting-edge, state-of-the-art solutions are mentioned also for reference, though the deep, thorough study of the latest solutions is not in scope in these slides.

Before tailoring a business-ready solution, the student is expected to double-check regular NLP handbooks and original sources to complete this training.
